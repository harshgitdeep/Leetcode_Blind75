# Maximum Product Subarray

**Problem Link:** [Maximum Product Subarray on LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-product-subarray)

## My Solution:

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProduct(int[] nums) {
        
        int max = nums[0], min = nums[0], ans = nums[0];
        
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
            
            int temp = max; 
            
            max = Math.max(Math.max(max * nums[i], min * nums[i]), nums[i]);
            min = Math.min(Math.min(temp * nums[i], min * nums[i]), nums[i]);
            
            if (max > ans) {
                ans = max;
            }
        }
        
        return ans;

    }
}
```

## My Approach:

- **Initialize Variables**:
  - `max` to keep track of the maximum product up to the current position.
  - `min` to keep track of the minimum product up to the current position (important for handling negative numbers).
  - `ans` to store the final maximum product found.

- **Iterate through the array** starting from the second element:
  - Store the current `max` value in a temporary variable `temp`.
  - Update `max` to be the maximum of:
    - The product of the current `max` and the current element.
    - The product of the current `min` and the current element.
    - The current element itself.
  - Update `min` to be the minimum of:
    - The product of the temporary variable `temp` (which holds the old `max`) and the current element.
    - The product of the current `min` and the current element.
    - The current element itself.
  - If the updated `max` is greater than `ans`, update `ans` to be the value of `max`.

- **Return `ans`** which holds the maximum product subarray found.

This approach ensures that both the maximum and minimum products are tracked at each step, which helps in handling cases involving negative numbers.
