## Linked List Problems

### 1. Reverse a Linked List
**Problem Link:** [Reverse Linked List - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/)

**My Solution:**
```java
class Solution {
    public ListNode reverseList(ListNode head) {
        ListNode prev = null;
        ListNode current = head;
        while (current != null) {
            ListNode nextTemp = current.next;
            current.next = prev;
            prev = current;
            current = nextTemp;
        }
        return prev;
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**
- Initialize `prev` to `null` and `current` to the head of the list.
- Traverse the list while `current` is not `null`:
  - Store the next node in `nextTemp`.
  - Reverse the `current` node's pointer to point to `prev`.
  - Move `prev` and `current` one step forward.
- Return `prev` as the new head of the reversed list.
