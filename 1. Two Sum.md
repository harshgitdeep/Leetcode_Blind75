[LeetCode - Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)

## My Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        int[] result = new int[2];
        
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();

        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            int complement = target - nums[i];
            
            if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
                result[0] = map.get(complement);
                result[1] = i;
                break;
            }
            map.put(nums[i], i);
        }

        return result;
    }
}
```

## Approach

- We use a HashMap to store the indices of elements as we iterate through the array.
- For each element, we calculate its complement (target - current number) and check if it exists in the map.
- If the complement exists, we return the indices of the current element and its complement from the map.
- If not, we add the current element to the map and continue.
- This way, we can find the two numbers that add up to the target sum.
