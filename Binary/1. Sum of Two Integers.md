[Sum of Two Integers](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-two-integers)

## My Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int getSum(int a, int b) {
        while(b != 0) {
            int temp = (a & b) << 1;
            a = a ^ b;
            b = temp;
        }
        return a;
    }
}
```

## Explanation

- The problem requires adding two integers without using the `+` or `-` operators.
- The solution leverages bit manipulation to achieve this.
- **Bitwise AND (`&`)**: Used to find carry bits where both `a` and `b` have `1`.
- **Left Shift (`<<`)**: The carry bits are shifted left by one to add them in the next higher bit.
- **Bitwise XOR (`^`)**: Used to find the sum without considering the carry.
- The loop continues until there are no carry bits left (`b` becomes 0).
- The final value of `a` is returned as the sum of the two integers.
