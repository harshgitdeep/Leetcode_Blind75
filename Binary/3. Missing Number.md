## My Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public int missingNumber(int[] nums) {
        
        int sum = 0;
        int n = nums.length;

        int actualsum = (n * (n + 1)) / 2;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            sum += nums[i];
        }

        int l = actualsum - sum;

        return l;
    }
}
```

## Explanation
- Calculate the expected sum of the first `n` natural numbers using the formula `n * (n + 1) / 2`.
- Initialize `sum` to 0 to store the sum of the elements in the given array.
- Iterate through the array and accumulate the sum of its elements.
- The missing number is found by subtracting the sum of the array elements from the expected sum.
- Return the missing number.
