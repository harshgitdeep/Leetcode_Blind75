### Problem Link
[Number of 1 Bits](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-1-bits)

### My Solution
```java
public class Solution {
    // you need to treat n as an unsigned value
    public int hammingWeight(int n) {
        
        int mask = 1;
        int bits = 0;

        for(int i=0;i<32;i++){

            if((n&mask)!=0){
                bits++;
            }
            mask<<=1;
        }
        return bits;
    }
}
```

### Explanation

- Initialize `mask` to 1 and `bits` to 0.
- Iterate over 32 bits of the integer:
  - For each bit, use bitwise AND (`&`) to check if the bit in `n` at the current position is 1.
  - If the bit is 1, increment the `bits` counter.
  - Shift the `mask` left by 1 to check the next bit in the next iteration.
- Return the total count of 1 bits.
