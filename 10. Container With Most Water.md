[Container With Most Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/)

### My Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxArea(int[] arr) {
        
        int area = 0 ;
        int a = 0;
        int b = arr.length-1;

        while(a<b){

            if(arr[a]<arr[b]){
                area = Math.max(area, arr[a]*(b-a));
                a++;
            }
            else{
                area = Math.max(area, arr[b]*(b-a));
                b--;
            }
        }
        return area;
    }
}
```

### Explanation
- **Initialize Variables:**
  - `area` to store the maximum water container area found.
  - `a` and `b` as pointers starting at the beginning and end of the array, respectively.
- **Iterate While Pointers Don't Cross:**
  - Compare the heights at `arr[a]` and `arr[b]`.
  - If `arr[a]` is less than `arr[b]`, calculate the area with `arr[a]` and the distance between `a` and `b`. Update `area` if this is larger than the current `area`. Move pointer `a` one step to the right.
  - If `arr[b]` is less than or equal to `arr[a]`, calculate the area with `arr[b]` and the distance between `a` and `b`. Update `area` if this is larger than the current `area`. Move pointer `b` one step to the left.
- **Return the Maximum Area Found:**
  - After the loop ends, `area` will contain the largest container area possible with the given heights.
