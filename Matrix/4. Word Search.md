```java
class Solution {
    public boolean exist(char[][] board, String word) {
        int m = board.length;
        int n = board[0].length;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (board[i][j] == word.charAt(0) && dfs(board, i, j, word, 0)) {
                    return true;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return false;
    }
    
    private boolean dfs(char[][] board, int i, int j, String word, int index) {
        if (index == word.length()) {
            return true;
        }
        
        if (i < 0 || i >= board.length || j < 0 || j >= board[0].length || board[i][j] != word.charAt(index)) {
            return false;
        }
        
        char temp = board[i][j];
        board[i][j] = ' ';
        
        boolean found = dfs(board, i + 1, j, word, index + 1) ||
                        dfs(board, i - 1, j, word, index + 1) ||
                        dfs(board, i, j + 1, word, index + 1) ||
                        dfs(board, i, j - 1, word, index + 1);
        
        board[i][j] = temp;
        
        return found;
    }
}
```

**Approach:**
1. **Depth-First Search (DFS):** Use DFS to explore the board starting from each cell to find if the word can be formed.
2. **Recursive Backtracking:** At each cell, check if it matches the current character of the word. If yes, mark the cell as visited (change to a special character), recursively explore neighboring cells to form the next part of the word, and backtrack if the word cannot be formed from that cell.

**Complexity:** 
- Time Complexity: O(m * n * 4^L) where m is the number of rows, n is the number of columns, and L is the length of the word. The 4^L factor accounts for the four possible directions in DFS.
- Space Complexity: O(L) for recursive stack space, where L is the length of the word.
