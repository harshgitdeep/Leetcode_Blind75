### Set Matrix Zeroes

**Problem Link:** [Set Matrix Zeroes on LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/set-matrix-zeroes/)

```java
class Solution {
    public void setZeroes(int[][] matrix) {
        int n = matrix.length;
        int m = matrix[0].length;

        int[] row = new int[n];
        int[] col = new int[m];

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
                if (matrix[i][j] == 0) {
                    row[i] = 1;
                    col[j] = 1;
                }
            }
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
                if (row[i] == 1 || col[j] == 1) {
                    matrix[i][j] = 0;
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Approach:**
1. **Initialization:** Initialize two arrays `row` and `col` to keep track of which rows and columns need to be zeroed out.
2. **Marking Zeroes:** Traverse through the matrix. If a cell contains a zero, mark the corresponding row and column in the `row` and `col` arrays.
3. **Zeroing Rows and Columns:** Traverse through the matrix again. For each cell, if its row or column was marked in the previous step, set the cell to zero.

**Complexity:** 
- Time Complexity: O(m * n) where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns.
- Space Complexity: O(m + n) for storing `row` and `col` arrays.
